This repo contains parts of my Ubuntu Touch port.

'device_samsung_crespo' is the configuration directory for the Ubuntu Touch/CM source tree.

'initrd' folder contains a initramfs written by me used as alternative to original Ubuntu initrd.

'get-ubuntu.sh' script is the usual script used to obtain the Ubuntu filesystem directly from Canonical/Ubuntu servers; the last update includes the possibility to remove the sample files (if they still exist in the image) and a necessary udev rule file creation (for newer images).


These pieces of software are released 'as-is', so use them at your own risk: I don't take any responsibility.



If you want to try a prebuilt Ubuntu Touch image, you can find on my topic on XDA: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2162735
